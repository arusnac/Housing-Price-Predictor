**Housing Price Predictor**

This application is a Python machine learning application that uses Flask as it's GUI. 

It takes in a dataset of Portland Housing Prices that were scraped off Zillow. With that data I built a model that used housing features to accurately predict how much
a house would sell for.

I chose Lasso Regression for this specific application because after testing a few others it performed the fastest and most accurately.

The project was meant to be a prototype for a business proposal (which is included in this repository).
